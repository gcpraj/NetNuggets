# Task 6: AWS EC2 Cloud Infrastructure üå©Ô∏è

## Why AWS EC2 is Essential for Modern Engineers

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** dominates the cloud infrastructure landscape, and **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is the foundation of cloud computing for engineers worldwide.

### **Industry Dominance**
- **32% of global cloud market share** - AWS leads all cloud providers
- **90% of Fortune 500 companies** use AWS services in some capacity
- **Millions of active customers** from startups to enterprises
- **200+ services** available in the AWS ecosystem

### **Why Engineers Need AWS Skills**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Deploy and manage servers programmatically
- **Scalability**: Scale resources up or down based on demand
- **Global Reach**: Deploy applications worldwide with minimal latency
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for resources you actually use
- **Career Advancement**: AWS skills are highly valued across all engineering disciplines

### **Real-World Applications**
- **Development Environments**: Spin up development servers in minutes
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Create isolated environments for testing
- **Production Deployments**: Host applications with enterprise-grade reliability
- **Data Processing**: Run compute-intensive workloads in the cloud
- **Learning Labs**: Practice with enterprise tools without hardware investment

## üéØ Your Mission (Coming Soon!)

In this task, you'll learn to:
- **Launch EC2 instances** for various engineering workloads
- **Configure security groups** and network access controls
- **Manage storage** with EBS volumes and instance storage
- **Automate deployments** using user data and cloud-init
- **Monitor and manage** cloud resources effectively
- **Apply cost optimization** strategies for efficient resource usage

But first, you need to prepare your AWS environment!

## Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account

### Free Tier Account (Recommended)
```
üîó Sign up at: https://aws.amazon.com/free/

AWS Free Tier includes:
‚úÖ 750 hours/month of EC2 t2.micro instances (12 months)
‚úÖ 30 GB of EBS storage (12 months)  
‚úÖ 5 GB of S3 storage (12 months)
‚úÖ 1 million API requests to Lambda (permanent)
‚úÖ Many other services with generous free tiers

Perfect for learning and small projects!
```

### Student Accounts (Even Better!)
If you're a student, take advantage of these programs:

**AWS Educate:**
```
üéì Visit: https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/

Benefits:
- $100-200 in AWS credits (varies by program)
- Additional free tier benefits
- Career resources and job board
- Access to AWS content and labs
```

**GitHub Student Developer Pack:**
```
üéí Visit: https://education.github.com/pack

Includes AWS credits plus:
- Free domains, hosting, and development tools
- Premium access to learning platforms
- Cloud credits for multiple providers
```

### Important Notes
- **Credit Card Required**: Even for free tier (but won't be charged within limits)
- **Billing Alerts**: Set up immediately to avoid unexpected charges
- **Region Selection**: Choose region closest to you for better performance
- **Free Tier Monitoring**: AWS provides tools to track your usage

## Step 2: Essential Preparation

### Before We Dive In
While detailed EC2 tutorials are coming in future updates, here's what you should do now:

1. **Create your AWS account** using one of the options above
2. **Verify your account** (may take a few hours)
3. **Set up billing alerts** to monitor your usage
4. **Explore the AWS Console** to familiarize yourself with the interface
5. **Review AWS Free Tier limits** to understand what's available

### Recommended Pre-Learning
- **AWS Getting Started Guide**: Basic AWS concepts and terminology
- **EC2 Overview Videos**: Understand virtual servers in the cloud
- **AWS Pricing Calculator**: Estimate costs for different configurations
- **Security Best Practices**: Basic AWS security fundamentals

## üí° Why Start with Account Setup Now?

### Account Verification Takes Time
AWS account verification can take several hours to complete. Starting this process now ensures you'll be ready when the detailed content is available.

### Free Tier Clock Starts Ticking
Your 12-month free tier period begins when you create your account, not when you start using services. Setting up now maximizes your learning time.

### Explore and Experiment
Having an active AWS account allows you to explore the console, read documentation, and get comfortable with the AWS ecosystem while waiting for detailed tutorials.
