## üéØ Your Mission

### Redo Previous Tasks with GitHub Copilot Pro

Now that you've completed the foundational Docker tasks manually, it's time to experience the power of AI-assisted development. You'll redo **Task 3 (Docker)** and **Task 4 (Docker Networking)** using GitHub Copilot Pro to see the dramatic difference in development speed and learning.

### Prerequisites
- **GitHub Copilot Pro subscription** (required for advanced features)
- **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extension installed
- **Completion of Task 3 and Task 4** (so you can compare the experience)

---

## Step 1: Setup GitHub Copilot Pro

### Install and Configure
```bash
# Install VS Code if not already installed
# Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Install GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code
# Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for "GitHub Copilot"
```

### Verify Copilot Access
1. Open VS Code
2. Sign in to GitHub account with Copilot Pro subscription
3. Check Copilot status in bottom-right corner of VS Code
4. Should show "GitHub Copilot: Ready"

---

## Step 2: Redo Task 3 - Docker with AI Assistance

### What to Focus On
- **Let Copilot suggest commands** instead of typing them manually
- **Ask Copilot Chat** to explain Docker concepts as you work
- **Use Copilot to generate** Docker configurations and scripts
- **Compare the experience** to doing it manually in Task 3

### Key Areas to Explore with Copilot
```bash
# Instead of remembering Docker commands, let Copilot suggest:
# - Container creation commands
# - Volume mounting syntax  
# - Port mapping configurations
# - Resource limitation parameters
# - Container management operations

# Use Copilot Chat to ask questions like:
# "How do I run Ubuntu container with specific memory limits?"
# "What's the best way to persist data in Docker containers?"
# "Explain the difference between docker run and docker exec"
```

### Document Your Experience
Create a comparison file: `copilot-experience-docker.md`
- **Time taken**: Compare manual vs AI-assisted approach
- **Learning curve**: What did Copilot help you understand faster?
- **Command accuracy**: How often were Copilot suggestions correct?
- **New insights**: What did you learn that you missed in Task 3?

---

## Step 3: Redo Task 4 - Docker Networking with AI

### Advanced AI Assistance
- **Complex network configurations**: Let Copilot generate multi-container setups
- **SONiC container commands**: Ask Copilot for networking-specific configurations
- **Troubleshooting**: Use AI to diagnose connectivity issues
- **Best practices**: Learn enterprise networking patterns through AI suggestions

### Copilot Chat Prompts to Try
```
"Create a Docker network setup with two SONiC containers connected via multiple links"

"How do I configure IP addresses on SONiC interfaces in containers?"

"Generate commands to test connectivity between Docker containers"

"What are best practices for Docker container networking in enterprise environments?"

"Help me troubleshoot ping failures between containers"
```

### Advanced Exploration
```bash
# Let Copilot help you go beyond the original task:
# - More complex network topologies
# - Additional network troubleshooting tools
# - Performance monitoring commands
# - Security best practices
# - Automation scripts for repetitive tasks
```
