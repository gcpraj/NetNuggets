# Task 2: Git Version Control for Engineers ðŸ“š

## Why Git is Critical for Modern Engineers

**Git** is the backbone of modern software development and engineering workflows:

### **Enterprise Reality**
- **95% of Fortune 500 companies** use Git for code and infrastructure management
- **Version Control**: All code, documentation, and configurations tracked in Git
- **Change Management**: All changes tracked, reviewed, and auditable
- **Collaboration**: Global teams work on projects simultaneously
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant recovery from code or configuration errors

### **Daily Engineering Use Cases**
- **Source Code**: Version control for applications and scripts
- **Documentation**: Technical docs, procedures, and guides
- **Configuration Files**: System configs, deployment scripts
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible playbooks
- **Change Tracking**: Who changed what, when, and why

### **Career Impact**
Git skills are **mandatory** for modern engineers. Without Git knowledge, you cannot participate in:
- Collaborative software development
- DevOps and automation workflows
- Modern deployment pipelines
- Team-based engineering projects

## Step 1: Initial Git Setup and Repository Pull

### Configure Git Identity
```bash
# Set your global Git configuration
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@company.com"

# Verify configuration
git config --list
```

### Clone the NetNuggets Repository
```bash
# Create workspace directory
mkdir ~/git-practice
cd ~/git-practice

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NetNuggets.git
cd NetNuggets

# Check repository status
git status
git log --oneline
```

---

## Step 2: Branch Creation and Modifications

### Create Your Personal Branch
```bash
# Create and checkout new branch (replace with your name and unique ID)
git checkout -b john_smith_001

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
git status
```

### Make File Modifications
```bash
# Create a new project documentation file
mkdir -p docs
cat > docs/project_notes.txt << EOF
Project Learning Notes - $(date)

This file contains my learning progress and observations while working through 
the NetNuggets project. I am documenting my journey to become proficient in 
modern engineering tools and practices.

Key areas of focus:
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration workflows
- Best practices for documentation
- Professional development skills

I will update this file as I progress through different tasks and learn 
new concepts. This serves as both a learning log and reference for future projects.
EOF

# Modify the main README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "## My Engineering Journey - $(date)" >> README.md
echo "Learning Git for version control and collaborative development." >> README.md
echo "This repository tracks my progress through various engineering concepts." >> README.md
```

---

## Step 3: Commit and Push Changes

### Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
# Check what files have changed
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add docs/project_notes.txt
git add README.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add project documentation and update README

- Added project learning notes with personal observations
- Updated README with engineering journey documentation
- Created docs directory for organized documentation"

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

### Push Branch to Remote Repository
```bash
# Push new branch to remote repository
git push origin john_smith_001

# Verify branch exists remotely
git branch -r
```

---

## Step 4: Clone Repository in Second Directory

### Create Second Working Directory
```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd ~/git-practice

# Clone repository to second location
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NetNuggets.git NetNuggets-second
cd NetNuggets-second

# Checkout your branch
git checkout john_smith_001

# Verify you're on correct branch
git branch
git log --oneline
```

---

## Step 5: Modify and Push from Second Directory

### Make Different Modifications
```bash
# Create a progress tracking file
cat > docs/progress_log.txt << EOF
Learning Progress Log - $(date)

Working from second directory to simulate collaborative development.

Completed Tasks:
1. Set up Git environment and basic configuration
2. Created initial project documentation
3. Successfully pushed first branch to remote repository

Current Focus:
- Understanding distributed Git workflows
- Learning collaboration patterns used in professional environments
- Practicing with multiple working directories

Next Steps:
- Continue exploring Git branch management
- Practice merge conflict resolution
- Study best practices for commit messages and documentation
EOF

# Add entry to README.md
echo "" >> README.md
echo "## Progress Update from Second Location - $(date)" >> README.md
echo "Added progress tracking and workflow documentation." >> README.md
echo "Learning distributed development patterns used in professional teams." >> README.md
```

### Commit and Push from Second Directory
```bash
# Stage and commit changes
git add docs/progress_log.txt
git add README.md

git commit -m "Add progress tracking from second workspace

- Added comprehensive progress log with completed tasks
- Updated README with workflow documentation updates  
- Documented learning focus and next steps"

# Push changes
git push origin john_smith_001
```

---

## Step 6: Pull Changes in First Directory

### Sync First Directory with Remote Changes
```bash
# Navigate back to first directory
cd ~/git-practice/NetNuggets

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin john_smith_001

# Verify changes are present
ls -la docs/
cat docs/progress_log.txt
tail README.md
```

---

## Step 7: Create Merge Conflict Scenario

### Modify Same File in Both Directories

**In First Directory:**
```bash
# Navigate to first directory
cd ~/git-practice/NetNuggets

# Edit the project notes file
cat >> docs/project_notes.txt << EOF

Updated from FIRST directory - $(date)
Added new insights and observations from my learning journey:

- Git workflows are essential for professional development
- Understanding branching helps manage different features and experiments
- Proper commit messages make project history much clearer
- Collaboration through version control is a critical skill

This update demonstrates working from multiple locations on the same project.
EOF

# Commit changes
git add docs/project_notes.txt
git commit -m "Add learning insights and workflow observations from first directory"
```

**In Second Directory:**
```bash
# Navigate to second directory  
cd ~/git-practice/NetNuggets-second

# Edit the SAME file with different content
cat >> docs/project_notes.txt << EOF

Updated from SECOND directory - $(date)
Continuing the learning process with additional observations:

- Distributed version control enables flexible development workflows
- Remote repositories serve as central collaboration points
- Merge conflicts are natural part of collaborative development
- Resolving conflicts requires understanding of both changes

Learning to handle multiple working directories and synchronization challenges.
EOF

# Commit changes
git add docs/project_notes.txt
git commit -m "Add distributed workflow insights and collaboration notes from second directory"
```

---

## Step 8: Experience Merge Conflicts

### Push from First Directory (Should Succeed)
```bash
# From first directory
cd ~/git-practice/NetNuggets
git push origin john_smith_001
```

### Push from Second Directory (Will Fail)
```bash
# From second directory
cd ~/git-practice/NetNuggets-second
git push origin john_smith_001

# This will fail with merge conflict message
# You'll see: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work..."
```

### Pull and Resolve Conflict
```bash
# Pull the conflicting changes
git pull origin john_smith_001

# Git will show merge conflict in the file
# View the conflict
cat docs/project_notes.txt

# You'll see conflict markers like:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Updated from SECOND directory - [timestamp]
# Continuing the learning process with additional observations:
# - Distributed version control enables flexible development workflows
# =======
# Updated from FIRST directory - [timestamp]  
# Added new insights and observations from my learning journey:
# - Git workflows are essential for professional development
# >>>>>>> [commit hash]
```

### Resolve the Merge Conflict
```bash
# Edit the file to resolve conflict manually
vi docs/project_notes.txt

# Remove conflict markers and combine both contributions:
cat > docs/project_notes.txt << EOF
Project Learning Notes - [original timestamp]

This file contains my learning progress and observations while working through 
the NetNuggets project. I am documenting my journey to become proficient in 
modern engineering tools and practices.

Key areas of focus:
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration workflows
